# Spotify Personal Streaming Data Analysis and Visualization Project

## Overview
In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis and visualization of my personal streaming data obtained from Spotify's website. The dataset spans from March 2023 to March 2024 and includes information about the tracks I streamed during this period. 

## Data Cleaning
To prepare the data for analysis, I performed various data cleaning tasks, including:
- Reading in json files as data frames
- Converting timestamps to datetime objects
- Handling missing values
- Extracting relevant features
- Converting data types for analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
I conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into my streaming habits. Some of the key analysis performed include:
- Calculating the total number of streams per day
- Identifying the most streamed tracks and artists
- Analyzing streaming patterns on weekdays vs. weekends
- Investigating trends over time

## Hypothesis Testing
To gain further insights, I conducted hypothesis testing to evaluate specific hypotheses about my streaming behavior. For example, I tested whether there was a significant difference in the average number of streams between weekdays and weekends using a two-sample t-test.

## Correlation Coefficient Testing
I also explored the correlation between different variables in the dataset. For instance, I calculated the correlation coefficient to measure the relationship between the number of streams per day and the total minutes played per day.

## Visualization
To communicate the findings effectively, I created various visualizations using Matplotlib. This includes bar plots and scatter plots to visualize trends, patterns, and relationships in the data.

## Summary
Overall, this project provides valuable insights into my streaming habits on Spotify over the past year. Through data analysis and visualization, I gained a better understanding of my music and podcast preferences, streaming patterns, and trends over time.

Please refer to the provided Python scripts for the detailed implementation of data cleaning, analysis, and visualization techniques used in this project.

I obtained my own streaming data from Spotify's website under Account/Privacy Settings/Download your data.
